          <p>
            We refer to our discussions on your placement structure and the
            reinsurers to be used to address your requirements. After taking
            these into account and/or your instructions we have obtained as
            follows the quote which we are recommending to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please read the notes given alongside the quote which give further
            information on any terms and conditions, exclusions, subjectivities
            and warranties which the Reinsurer(s) has/have stipulated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please review this quote to confirm that it accurately reflects your

          </p>
          <p>
            Since this is a quote, it may not constitute confirmation of full or
            further support at these terms, nor does it confirm actual
            reinsurance cover. We therefore look forward to confirmation of firm
            order from you as soon as possible so that we can bind cover at
            these terms and have sufficient time to seek additional support from
            Reinsurers.
          </p>
          <h1>Choice of Reinsurer(s)</h1>

            are not contractually obliged to recommend reinsurance cover only
            with the reinsurer(s) we have recommended to you.
          </p>

            seek revalidation of terms with (re)insurers. We take this
            opportunity to remind you that your client has a duty, to disclose
            all information which is material to your coverage requirements, or
            which might influence (re)insurers in deciding to accept your
            business, finalising the terms to apply and/or the cost of cover.
            Failure to make such disclosure may allow insurers to avoid the
            policy. This is an ongoing responsibility throughout the duration of
            your clientâ€™s policy.
